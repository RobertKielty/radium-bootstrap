Radium Bootstrap is an implementation of the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) UI framework written with [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Radium](http://projects.formidablelabs.com/radium/), a React component styling library.

Radium is a set of tools to manage inline styles on React elements. It gives you powerful styling capabilities without CSS.

We're looking for contributors! Help us port all of Bootstrap to Radium on [GitHub](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium-bootstrap).
